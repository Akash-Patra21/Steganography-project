# Steganography-project

"Code Crypt" is a project focused on the application of steganography, the technique of concealing secret information within ordinary, non-confidential files or messages, to ensure secure communication. In this project, we specifically employ digital images as carriers for hidden data, embedding the secret information in a way that is imperceptible to the human eye while preserving the original appearance and integrity of the image. This technique adds an additional layer of security by masking the very existence of the confidential data, making it difficult to detect without specialized knowledge or tools.
